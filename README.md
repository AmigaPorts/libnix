## Overview

This **libnix** version is used in conjuction with [amiga-gcc](https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc) project. It's a standard C link library for the gcc cross compiler targeting AmigaOS/m68k systems.

I fixed and added plenty files and don't expect the changes to get accepted, since this version relies on system headers from newlib.

Good luck using this^^.
